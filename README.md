[*Knowledge Assessment of Moose (Alces alces) in Alberta's Oil Sands Region*](https://mabecker89.github.io/OSM-Synthesis-Moose/OSMMooseReview_v3)

The following interactive maps of various moose population parameters, data, and models are available here:

+ [Density](https://mabecker89.github.io/OSM-Synthesis-Moose/density)
> *Calculations of moose density are based on Government of Alberta aerial survey reports from 2013-2018*
+ [Aerial observations from surveys](https://mabecker89.github.io/OSM-Synthesis-Moose/heatmap)
> *Latitude/Longitude locations of moose sightings during aerial surveys from 2013-2018*
+ [ABMI relative abundance predictions (1km<sup>2</sup> grid)](https://mabecker89.github.io/OSM-Synthesis-Moose/relabund)
> *Based on ABMI habitat association modeling*

A description of the methods used to compare aerial survey and camera trap moose density estimates is available [here](https://mabecker89.github.io/OSM-Synthesis-Moose/aerial-camera-comp_2)
